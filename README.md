# Simplee ToDo

Simplee ToDo is the next app I am working on getting onto the App Store. This is a simple app that tracks tasks and notifies the user when a task is due. This was my practice to get familiar with SwiftUI. 

## Roadmap

- Recurring Tasks
- Widget View
- Sharing tasks with others
- Update tasks between users

## Privacy Policy

No data is stored on a server. All task data, at this time, is stored on the users device.
